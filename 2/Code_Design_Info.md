 ### Analysis of Code Information in Relation to Requirements

#### Relevant API Functions and Parameters

1. **Thermal Monitoring Unit (TMU) Configuration and Monitoring:**
   - **API Functions:**
     - `Tmu_Ip_EnableMonitoringSite(Instance, ConfigPtr->MonitoringSitesMask)`: Enables monitoring sites, ensuring the system monitors the specified sensor sites.
     - `TMU_SetCalibrationPoints(Base, ConfigPtr->NumCalibrationConfigs, ConfigPtr->CalibrationConfig)`: Configures calibration points, aligning with the requirement to configure TMU registers for calibration.
     - `Base->TCMCFG |= TMU_TCMCFG_OCM(ConfigPtr->OffsetCancellation ? 1UL : 0UL) | TMU_TCMCFG_DEMA(ConfigPtr->DynamicMatchAvrg ? 1UL : 0UL)`: Sets the Offset Cancellation Mode (OCM) and Dynamic Element Match Averaging (DEMA), fulfilling the requirement to configure DEMA and OCM of TCMCFG register.
     - `TMU_ConfigTemperatureMonitor`: Configures temperature monitoring, supporting the requirement to read and monitor temperature at specified intervals.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `ConfigPtr->MonitoringSitesMask`: Determines which sensor sites are enabled for monitoring.
     - `ConfigPtr->NumCalibrationConfigs` and `ConfigPtr->CalibrationConfig`: Used for setting calibration points.
     - `ConfigPtr->OffsetCancellation` and `ConfigPtr->DynamicMatchAvrg`: Used to configure specific modes in the TCMCFG register.

2. **Temperature Monitoring Intervals:**
   - **API Constants:**
     - `THERMAL_MONITORING_INTERVAL_TYPE_1` to `THERMAL_MONITORING_INTERVAL_TYPE_11`: These constants define different temperature monitoring intervals, which can be mapped to the specified intervals of 10ms and 125ms in the requirements.

3. **Interrupt Configuration:**
   - **API Function:**
     - `TMU_ConfigThresholdInterrupt(Base, IrqEn, ThresholdInterruptMask[(uint32)ThrType])`: Configures interrupts for temperature thresholds, aligning with the requirement to trigger degradation if temperature exceeds configured thresholds.

#### Mapping Code Information to Requirements

1. **TMU Configuration and Monitoring:**
   - The code provides functions to enable monitoring sites, configure calibration points, and set specific modes in the TCMCFG register, directly fulfilling the requirement to configure and monitor the TMU.

2. **Temperature Monitoring:**
   - The code includes constants for various monitoring intervals, which can be used to implement the requirement of monitoring temperatures at 10ms and 125ms intervals.

3. **Threshold and Interrupt Handling:**
   - The function `TMU_ConfigThresholdInterrupt` aligns with the requirement to handle temperature thresholds and trigger appropriate safety states.

4. **Safety and Security:**
   - While the code does not explicitly mention ASIL levels, the configuration and monitoring functions are critical for safety, aligning with the ASIL B/D focus in the requirements.

5. **Constraints and Dependencies:**
   - The code assumes the presence of specific hardware components (e.g., TMU) and their correct configuration, which aligns with the constraints and assumptions in the requirements.

Overall, the code information provides the necessary API functions and parameters to implement the functional requirements related to TMU configuration and monitoring, temperature monitoring intervals, and handling temperature thresholds. The non-functional requirements related to safety and performance are implicitly supported through the configuration and monitoring capabilities provided by the code.
