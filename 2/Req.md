### Functional Requirements

1. **Thermal Monitoring Unit (TMU) Configuration and Monitoring:**
   - The SOC shall enable the TMU (Thermal Monitoring Unit) (ID 2563803).
   - The software shall configure various TMU registers for calibration and monitoring:
     - Temperature configuration register (TTCFGR) for each calibration point (ID 2486671).
     - Sensor Configuration (TSCFGR) for each calibration point (ID 2486672).
     - Temperature range control registers (TTRCR) for each calibration point (ID 2486679).
     - DEMA and OCM of TCMCFG register with value 1 (ID 2486675).
   - The software shall enable and monitor three sensor sites for temperature monitoring (ID 2509062, 2551646).
   - The software shall read and monitor temperature from on-chip sensors at specified intervals (10ms and 125ms) (ID 2509063, 2509064).

2. **Watchdog and Fault Injection:**
   - The software shall check fault injection by serving watchdog incorrectly for µP and µC (ID 2868991, 2868992).
   - The software shall check good watchdog refresh for µC and µP (ID 2874238, 2874239).

3. **Memory Protection and Management:**
   - The software shall enable the memory protection unit in each of the 4 cores (ID 2829251).
   - The software shall enable the Memory Management Unit on A53 core2 and core3 (ID 2829254).

4. **ECU-mc Blade Temperature Monitoring:**
   - The software shall monitor the internal ambient temperature cyclically every 50ms (ID 2841370).
   - The software shall include a DTC mechanism for temperature threshold exceedance (ID 2841397).
   - The software shall trigger degradation if temperature exceeds configured thresholds (ID 2841401).

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Safety and Security:**
   - Most requirements are classified under ASIL B or ASIL D, indicating a focus on safety-critical operations.
   - Security is marked as false across requirements, indicating no specific security measures are required.

2. **Verification and Validation:**
   - Verification levels include code/configuration review and SW qualification tests.
   - Validation is performed through specific RT-IDs linked to review tools.

3. **Performance:**
   - Temperature monitoring and response times are specified (e.g., 10ms, 50ms, 125ms intervals).
   - Lifetime and load profiles, including power on reset and ignition cycles, are mentioned (ID 461722-461725).

### Constraints, Dependencies, and Assumptions

1. **Constraints:**
   - The TMU must be configured and monitored according to specific register settings and intervals.
   - The system must handle temperature thresholds and trigger appropriate safety states.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - The implementation and validation of requirements are dependent on specific architecture elements and review tools.

3. **Assumptions:**
   - The system assumes the availability of specific hardware components (e.g., TMU, memory units) and their correct configuration.
   - It is assumed that the safety and performance requirements are aligned with ASIL B/D standards.

This summary captures the core functional and non-functional requirements, highlighting the focus on thermal monitoring, safety, and system configuration. Constraints and dependencies are noted to ensure proper system design and implementation.
