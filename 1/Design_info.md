### Mapping of Requirements to Design Information:

1. **TMU Configuration:**
   - **Requirement:** Configure TMU registers such as TTCFGR[CAL_PT], TSCFGR, TTRCR, and TCMCFG.
   - **Design Info:** The Thermal driver initializes and controls the TMU hardware using an application-provided configuration structure. The `Thermal_Init()` function configures the sensor calibration values for the temperature sensor.

2. **Temperature Monitoring:**
   - **Requirement:** Enable three sensor sites and monitor every 125ms; monitor internal ambient temperature every 50ms.
   - **Design Info:** The Thermal driver enables and disables monitoring sites and retrieves current temperature at each site. The `TmuMonitoringSite` container in Tresos allows configuration of monitoring intervals.

3. **Watchdog and Fault Injection:**
   - **Requirement:** Serve the watchdog incorrectly for fault injection and check good watchdog refresh.
   - **Design Info:** Not explicitly covered in the provided design information.

4. **Memory Protection:**
   - **Requirement:** Enable memory protection unit in each of the 4 cores and MMU on A53 core2 and core3.
   - **Design Info:** Not explicitly covered in the provided design information.

5. **Deviation Acceptance:**
   - **Requirement:** Accept deviation from top and bottom panel NTC absolute temperature difference if ≤ 2°C.
   - **Design Info:** Not explicitly covered in the provided design information.

### Relevant API Functions and Parameters:

- **Thermal_Init():** Initializes the TMU hardware. Must be called during the STARTUP phase of EcuM initialization.
- **Thermal_Deinit():** De-initializes the TMU hardware during the SHUTDOWN phase of EcuM.
- **Tmu_SetUserAccessAllowed(uint32 TmuBaseAddr):** Sets user access allowed for TMU registers.
- **Tmu_ClearUserAccessAllowed(uint32 TmuBaseAddr):** Clears user access allowed for TMU registers.

### Protocols and Constraints:

- **Initialization Constraint:** TMU must be initialized during software initialization (`Thermal_Init()` must be called before any other Thermal function).
- **User Mode Support:** The module can run in user mode if `ThermalEnableUserModeSupport` is enabled.
- **Interrupt Handling:** The ISR macro is used to define functions that process hardware interrupts. The ISR for temperature alarm is `ISR(Tmu_Isr)`.

### Assumptions and Dependencies:

- **Assumptions:** Availability of three temperature sensors and independent monitoring capability.
- **Dependencies:** Integration with AutosarOS for user mode support, and dependencies on modules like Mcu, Det, Base, Resource, RTE, and EcuC.
