### Explanation of the Sequence Diagram:

1. **Actors and Participants:**
   - **Application:** Represents the external entity or software that interacts with the Thermal Driver.
   - **Thermal Driver:** The software component responsible for initializing, configuring, and managing the TMU hardware.
   - **TMU Hardware:** The physical hardware component that is configured and monitored by the Thermal Driver.

2. **TMU Initialization:**
   - The sequence begins with the `Application` invoking the `Thermal_Init()` function on the `ThermalDriver`.
   - The `ThermalDriver` then configures the TMU hardware registers such as TTCFGR[CAL_PT], TSCFGR, TTRCR, and TCMCFG.

3. **Temperature Monitoring:**
   - The `Application` requests the `ThermalDriver` to enable monitoring sites.
   - The `ThermalDriver` enables the sensor sites on the `TMUHardware`.
   - A loop is established to retrieve temperature data from sensor sites every 125ms.
   - Another loop retrieves internal ambient temperature data every 50ms.

4. **De-initialization:**
   - The `Application` calls the `Thermal_Deinit()` function to de-initialize the TMU.
   - The `ThermalDriver` then de-configures the TMU hardware.

### Components/Modules Derived from the Requirements:

1. **Application Layer:**
   - Responsible for initiating the TMU configuration and monitoring processes.

2. **Thermal Driver:**
   - Manages the initialization, configuration, and monitoring of the TMU hardware.

3. **TMU Hardware:**
   - The physical component that is configured and monitored for temperature data.
