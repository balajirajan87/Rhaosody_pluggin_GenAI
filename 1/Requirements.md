#### Requirements Summary: 
### Functional Requirements

1. **TMU (Thermal Monitoring Unit) Configuration:**
   - The software shall configure various TMU registers such as TTCFGR[CAL_PT], TSCFGR, TTRCR, and TCMCFG for each calibration point to ensure proper functioning.
   - The software shall enable the three sensor sites for temperature monitoring and monitor all temperature sites every 125ms.
   - The software shall disable the monitoring mode using the TMU Mode register TMR[MODE].

2. **Temperature Monitoring:**
   - The TMU module shall monitor temperatures from 233K to 398K and can issue warnings for over or under temperature conditions.
   - The software shall monitor the internal ambient temperature cyclically every 50ms within the MPCI system.

3. **Watchdog and Fault Injection:**
   - The software shall check fault injection by serving the watchdog incorrectly for both µP and µC.
   - The software shall check good watchdog refresh for both µP and µC.

4. **Memory Protection:**
   - The software shall enable the memory protection unit in each of the 4 cores and the Memory Management Unit on A53 core2 and core3.

5. **Deviation Acceptance:**
   - The software shall accept the deviation from the top and bottom panel NTC absolute temperature difference as valid if it is less than or equal to 2 degrees Celsius.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Safety and Security:**
   - All requirements are classified under ASIL B or ASIL D, indicating a focus on safety-critical operations.
   - Security is marked as false, indicating no specific security requirements are addressed.

2. **Verification and Validation:**
   - Verification levels include code/configuration review and SW qualification tests.
   - Validation is performed through specific RT-IDs linked to review tools.

### Constraints and Assumptions

1. **Constraints:**
   - The TMU module must be initialized during software initialization.
   - Specific register values (e.g., DEMA = 1, OCM = 1) are required for proper TMU functioning.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - The software requirements are dependent on specific architecture elements and are implemented by a designated team (SWE1).

3. **Assumptions:**
   - The system assumes the availability of three temperature sensors and the ability to monitor them independently.
   - The system assumes that the TMU can signal alarms based on programmed events.

This summary captures the core functional and non-functional requirements, along with constraints, dependencies, and assumptions that may impact the system design.
